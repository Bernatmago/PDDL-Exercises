# Planning problems using PDDL
This repository contains two planning problems defined and solved with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as required on our planning course.

The exercices were part of the Planning and Approximate Reasoning subject of the AI master at UPC.

To run any solution just import a problem file with its corresponding domain into a PDDL solver. (For example http://editor.planning.domains/)
