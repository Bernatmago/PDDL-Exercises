20 - a) Define two very different ways to represent the lunar lockout world (objects, states, actions,
domain axioms). Ensure there is a big difference in the set of possible states between both
representations.

objects: spapaceship
states: x, y
actions: up, down, right, left

20 - b) Explain the number of possible states for both representations that you came up with. Do they
also differ in the number of feasible states? Explain why each representation would be preferable
to the other.

60 - c) Write the PDDL files required for a planner of your choice to solve this problem (Hint: a statespace search is likely the most simple). We should be able to run your code with something like
the following command: /lunar-lockout <domain.pddl> <problem.pddl>. The <domain .pddl>
should define the lunar lockout world actions and predicates. If you wish, you can hardcode the
domain representation into your suggested planner but be sure to state this in your README.
The <problem .pddl> contains the objects, init state, and goal state. The output of your planner
should be a sequence of actions that solves the given puzzles. Explain how we should interpret
the output. It is OK to use a more compact representation.
